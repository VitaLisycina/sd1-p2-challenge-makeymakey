# Function design document Pong
In this file, all the info you need for your challenge assignment is included.

## Functional requirements
* Player movement - The pedals should be able to move up and down. The left pedal should move with W and S, the right pedal with the Up and Down buttons.
* Ball movement - The ball should have a base speed and move to a random side (and have a random angle towards that player) when the game is started.
* Player/Ball interaction - When the ball touches a pedal, it should change its direction. 
* Point scoring - When the ball touches the left side the right player should get a point and vice versa.
* After goal sequence - When a point is scored the ball should reset in the middle and move towards the player who didn't get a point.
* Overall goal - The game ends when one player has 10 points, that player then wins the game.
* Restarting - You should be able to restart a game with the press of a button.
