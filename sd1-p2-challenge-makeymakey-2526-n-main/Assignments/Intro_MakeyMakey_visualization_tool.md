## Controls

The default controls are the arrow keys. Each key will make the particles gravitate to a different point. Multiple keys can be held at the same time.

In the parameters you can change which key will activate the particles.

## Assignment

With your group, propose a project made with this tool.
For this project you should:

- How would you visualize the finished project? (big screen, old televisions, projector/projection mapping on wall, ground or ceiling)
- Change the parameters to create a unique visualization
- Craft a creative way to control the visualization
