# Project
This project will be done in groups of 2!

## Ideating
* Look at all the ideas that you gathered
* Shortly work out at least 3 ideas that you think would be fun to make with the MakeyMakey. These can be existing ideas, but also your own.
* Make the top 3, with the one you would like the most on top.

## Proposal
* Propose these ideas to the teacher, together with him you'll choose your final idea (or you'll be send back to the drawing board).
 
## GO
* When the teacher agrees with your proposal your can start collecting what materials you need and get to work!

## Deadline and hand in
* The deadline will be the last class of this module.
* You will hand in a video of your project in a folder in the repo.
