# Physical Pong Controller
## Temporarily changing the Pong game
* Open your Unity project from last time with Pong 2D (Basic version)
* Change the interaction from the left player (W and S) to interacting with the left and right arrow in your script.

## The physical interaction
* Make 4 small pressure plates.
* Connect these plates to the MakeyMakey
* Connect the MakeyMakey to your laptop and get Pong to work with this physical interaction.
