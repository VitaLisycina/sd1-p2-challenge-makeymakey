## Wordlist

* Physical computing = the art of programming physical objects to interact with the digital world.
* Input = Data or signals received by a system from an external source. In physical computing, inputs often come from sensors that detect physical phenomena like light, temperature, or motion.
* Sensor = A device that detects a physical quantity and converts it into a measurable electrical signal. Examples include photoresistors, thermistors, and potentiometers.
* Output = Data or signals sent from a system to an external destination. In physical computing, outputs are typically used to control actuators like motors, LEDs, or speakers.
* Circuit = An interconnected network of electrical components that allows current to flow and perform a specific function.
* Analog = A continuous signal that can take on any value within a given range.
* Digital = A discrete signal that can only take on specific values, typically 0 or 1.
